# Part Three: Citation Chaining

`Citation chaining` is a powerful search strategy that allows you to move backwards and forwards through a research topic.

When using `citation chaining`, you can find historic, current, and related research, and also identify how a topic has grown or changed over time.

## Backward citation chaining

Backward citation chaining refers to using the reference list from a relevant source to discover additional related sources.

This process is relatively straightforward:
* When reading a source (article, book, etc.), make notes of cited sources related to your topic
* Find those sources in the reference list, footnotes, endnotes, etc.
* Find the full-text of the source
  * Journal article: Follow the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/1-journals.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> on searching in specific journals
  * Book: Search the <a href ="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/?_ga=2.8463987.734477797.1519142255-1596890762.1509730084" target="_blank">library catalog </a>to see if we have access
