# Part Three: Citation Chaining

`Citation chaining` is a powerful search strategy that allows you to move backwards and forwards through a research topic.

When using `citation chaining`, you can find historic, current, and related research, and also identify how a topic has grown or changed over time.

## Backward citation chaining

`Backward citation chaining` refers to using the reference list from a relevant source to discover additional related sources.

This process is relatively straightforward:
* When reading a source (article, book, etc.), make notes of cited sources related to your topic
* Find the sources in the reference list, footnotes, endnotes, etc.
* Find the full-text of the source
  * Journal article: Follow the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/1-journals.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> on searching in specific journals
  * Book: Search the <a href ="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/?_ga=2.8463987.734477797.1519142255-1596890762.1509730084" target="_blank">library catalog </a>to see if we have access

## Forward citation chaining in Google Scholar
`Forward citation chaining` refers to identifying articles that have cited another article since it was published.
* Visit <a href ="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>
* Copy and paste or type the article title in the search box
  * Example: Race and trust in the health care system
* Click on search or the magnifying glass
* On the results page, click `Cited by...`

You will now see articles that cited, in their own reference lists, the initial article you searched for. 

You can even search within these citing articles.
* Click to check the `Search within citing articles box`
* Type your keywords in the search box
  * Example: vaccines
* Click on search or the magnifying glass

You will now see articles that include specific keywords AND cited the initial article you searched for.
