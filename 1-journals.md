# Part One: Search in Specific Journals

When doing research, it can often be helpful to start your search within specific journals that are related to your topic or discipline.

First, we need to find the journal we are interested in.
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Journals` below the search box
* On the new page, type the `journal name` in the search box
  * Example: Public Understanding of Science
* Click `Go` or hit `Enter` on your keyboard
* Click the `title of the result` that provides `Online access`
* Under `View It`, click the link that provides access to either `current` or historic` volumes/issues
* Enter your NetID if prompted 

Now that we found the journal, we can search within it.
* Type your keywords in the search box
  * Example: vaccines AND opinions AND trust
    * Visit the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/4-syntax.html" target="_blank">Search Syntax</a> tab to learn more about `AND` and other ways to structure your search
	* Make sure you search in only `This Journal` instead of `All Journals`
* Hit `Enter` on your keyboard, click `Search`, etc.
Browse the results and click on an article you are interested in
* Read the article online or download the PDF
