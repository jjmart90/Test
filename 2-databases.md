# Part Two: Search Library Databases
Databases can be helpful places to search as they include peer-reviewed articles from multiple journals.

First, we need to find the database we are interested in.
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Articles & Databases` below the search box
* On the new page:
  * Option 1: Click on `View our Databases A-Z list`
  * Option 2: Click a `Databases by Subject` link
    * For this example, we are going to click `Sociology/Criminology`
* Scroll to and click on the database you are interested in
* Enter your NetID if prompted 

Now that we selected a database, we can search within it.
* Type your keywords in the search box
  * Example: vaccines AND opinions AND trust
    * Visit the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/4-syntax.html" target="_blank">Search Syntax</a> tab to learn more about `AND` and other ways to structure your search
* Hit `Enter` on your keyboard, click `Search`, etc.
* On the results page, the most useful limiters are:
  * Peer reviewed
  * Full text
  * Source type
  * Publication date
* Browse the results and click on an article you are interested in
  * Read the `Abstract/Details
  * Identify useful `subject headings`
    * `Subject headings` are the terms databases use to describe specific concepts
	  * Adding `subject heading` terms to your search can be very helpful
* Access the full-text of the article
  * Read the article online or download the PDF
  * Click the `Find It` icon to check for full-text and follow links
    * If we don't have the full-text, request it for **free** via <a href ="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/" target="_blank">Interlibrary Loan"
