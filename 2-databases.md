# Part Two: Search Library Databases
Databases can be helpful places to search as they include peer-reviewed articles from multiple journals.

## Select a library database
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Articles & Databases` below the search box
* On the new page:
  * Option 1: Click on `View our Databases A-Z list`
  * Option 2: Click a `Databases by Subject` link
    * Example: `Sociology/Criminology`
* Scroll to and click on the database you are interested in
  * Example: Sociological Abstracts
* Enter your Vandal NetID if prompted 

## Search in a library database
Now that we selected a database, we can search within it.
* Type your keywords in the search box
  * Example: vaccines AND opinions AND trust
    * Visit the <a href="https://jylisadoney.github.io/soc-341/4-syntax.html" target="_blank">Search Syntax tab</a> to learn more about `AND`
* Hit `Enter` on your keyboard or click `Search`

## Select relevant search results
We can now see a list of results that are related to our keywords/topic.

On the results page, you can limit your results by:
  * Peer reviewed articles
  * Full text access
  * Source type
  * Publication date
  
Browse the results and click on an article you are interested in.
* Read the `Abstract/Details`
* Identify useful `subject headings`
  * Subject headings are the terms databases use to describe specific concepts
	* Adding subject headings to your search can be very helpful
