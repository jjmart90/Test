# Introduction

## Key Terminology

Learning Excel is kind of like learning a new language.

An entire Excel file is called a `workbook` and every workbook includes `sheets`. When you open a new Excel file, Sheet1 is automatically created at the bottom of the workbook. 

`Excel workbooks can have multiple sheets.`

The data in Excel workbooks are organized into `columns` and `rows`. The intersection between a column and a row is a `cell`.

`Tabs` appear at the top of the workbook and help you utilize many Excel features, such as creating charts and graphs or sorting your data.

The `formula bar` is where you can see the formulas and functions you've inserted into certain cells.

## File Names and Versioning

After opening an Excel workbook, it is important to save, name, and version it so it is easy to find in the future.

In your file name, you can include:
* Assignment or project names
* Your name or initials
* Date of last edit
* Version number
* Geographic coordinates
* Type of data, etc.

`For example: SOC320_JRD_20180205_v001`

Spaces don't work well in file names, but you can use `underscores (_)` or `dashes (-)` instead. 

Special characters should also be avoided: `~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " |`
```

If you include dates in your file names, it helps to insert them as YYYYMMDD to make sure your files stay in chronological order.

When versioning your files with numbers, consider using `leading zeros` (001, 002 ... 010 ... 100) so that files sort properly.

Finally, keep your file naming as consistent as possible within the same assignment or project.
* SOC320_JRD_20180205_v001
* SOC320_JRD_20180205_v002
* SOC320_JRD_20180205_v010
