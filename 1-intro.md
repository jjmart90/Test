# Introduction to Key Terminology

Learning Excel is kind of like learning a new language.

The entire Excel file is called a *workbook*. The workbook will most likely include *sheets*; when you open a new Excel file, Sheet1 is automatically created at the bottom of the file. Excel *workbooks* can have multiple *sheets*.

The data in Excel workbooks are organized into *columns* and *rows*. The intersection between a column and a row is a *cell*.

*Tabs* appear at the top of the workbook and help you utilize many Excel features, such as creating charts and graphs or sorting your data.

The *formula bar* is where you can see the formulas and functions you've inserted into certain cells.

After opening an Excel workbook, it is important to save our file and name and version it in a way that includes enough detail but it also easy to understand.

In your file name, you can include:
*Assignment or project names
*Your name or initials
*Date of last edit
*Version number
*Geographic coordinates, etc.

For example: SOC320_JRD_20180205_v001

Some software does not recognize spaces in file names so it is best to use underscores _ or dashes - instead. Also, file names often can't recognize special characters like ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " |, so you should avoid those as well.

It is also helpful to write dates as YYYYMMDD to make sure they stay in chronological order.

When versioning your files with numbers, consider using leading zeros so that files sort properly:
*001, 002 ... 010 ... 100

Finally, keep your file naming as consistent as possible within the same assignment or project.
*SOC320_JRD_20180205_v001
*SOC320_JRD_20180205_v002
*SOC320_JRD_20180205_v010
