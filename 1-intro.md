# Introduction to Key Terminology

Learning Excel is kind of like learning a new language.

The entire Excel file is called a *workbook*. The workbook will most likely include *sheets*; when you open a new Excel file, Sheet1 is automatically created at the bottom of the file. Excel *workbooks* can have multiple *sheets*.

The data in Excel workbooks are organized into *columns* and *rows*. The intersection between a column and a row is a *cell*.

*Tabs* appear at the top of the workbook and help you utilize many Excel features, such as creating charts and graphs or sorting your data.

The *formula bar* is where you can see the formulas and functions you've inserted into certain cells.
